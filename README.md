PROJECT: HEALTH CARE
1. Introduction
This report presents an analysis of a healthcare dataset, covering exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, feature engineering, model building, and model evaluation. The objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models to enhance healthcare decision-making.
2. Project Objectives
1.	Exploring & analysing the dataset using proper EDA methods.
2.	Visualizing the cleaned data for better understanding.
3.	Creating new features and applying standardization or normalization using feature engineering.
4.	Building and experimenting with different machine learning models.
5.	Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
6.	Enhancing accuracy through model tuning and comparing performance.
7.	Data visualization using Power BI.
3. Data Exploration and Cleaning
Data Loading
The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and the first few rows were examined to understand its structure.
Summary Statistics
Basic statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles were calculated to understand numerical feature distributions.
Handling Missing Values
No missing values were detected during the analysis.
Handling Duplicates
Duplicate rows were detected and removed to maintain data integrity.
Encoding Categorical Variables
Encoding did not required cause all the data numerical.
4. Data Visualization
Numerical Feature Distribution
Histograms and box plots were created to analyze feature distributions and detect outliers.
Categorical Feature Visualization
Bar charts and pie charts were used to represent the frequency distribution of categorical variables.
Correlation Heatmap
A heatmap was generated to analyze the correlation between numerical variables and identify potential multicollinearity.
Pair Plots
Pair plots were used to visualize relationships between different features.
5. Feature Engineering
•	Created new date-related features from timestamps.
•	Generated interaction terms between key clinical features.
•	Scaled numerical variables for better model performance.
6. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
 Dataset Splitting
•	The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratification.
 Model Selection & Training
•	Logistic Regression: Used as a baseline classification model.
•	Decision Tree & Random Forest: Implemented to improve classification performance.
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Added for comparison.
 Hyperparameter Tuning
•	RandomizedSearchCV was used for tuning hyperparameters of Random Forest.
•	The best parameters were selected to improve accuracy and F1-score.


7. Model Evaluation
 Performance Metrics
The models were evaluated using:
•	Accuracy
•	Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Comparison of Models:

**Model	                 Accuracy	 F1-Score**
Logistic Regression   	 64.47%	     0.64
Decision Tree         	 52%         0.519
Random Forest (Tuned)    65%	       0.6509
KNN	                     59.3%	     0.5930

Best Model: Tuned Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (65%) and F1-score (0.6509).
8. Data Visualization with Power BI
Importing Processed Data
The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI for further visualization.
Dashboard Creation
Interactive dashboards were created to display:
•	Distribution of numerical features
•	Comparison of categorical features
•	Correlation heatmap
•	Key model metrics and performance indicators
Interactive Exploration
Power BI’s dynamic tools, such as slicers and filters, were used to enhance data exploration.
9. Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed a healthcare dataset, applied machine learning techniques, and visualized key findings using Power BI. The implementation of feature engineering, model selection, and tuning helped improve model accuracy. These insights can be valuable for healthcare decision-making and predictive analytics.
